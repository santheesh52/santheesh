<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
    <li>HTML: For creating the structure of the calculator</li>
    <li>CSS: For styling and layout</li>
    <li>JavaScript: For handling the calculator logic and user interactions</li>
</ul>

<h1>How It Works</h1>
<ul>
  <li>HTML: The calculator interface consists of buttons for digits, operators, and other functions (e.g., clear, equals).</li>
  <li>CSS: Styles are applied to arrange the calculator buttons in a grid layout and provide a clean look.</li>
  <li>JavaScript: The logic of the calculator (handling operations and displaying results) is implemented using event listeners for button clicks and basic arithmetic operations.</li>
</ul>
